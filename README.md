# KaggleCreditCardDataset-ClassificationModel
My goal is to create a Classification Model from Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud dataset. I will be using pipeline fucntion to run multiples classification models together. I will be using the PCA function for dimensionality reduction (selecting columns). Lastly, will be using SMOTE function to even the dependent variable (y variable).
