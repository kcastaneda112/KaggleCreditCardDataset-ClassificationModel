# KaggleCreditCardDataset-ClassificationModel
My goal was to create a Classification Model from Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud dataset. I will be using pipeline function to run multiple classification models together. I will be using the PCA function for dimensionality reduction (selecting columns that make the most impact). Lastly, will be using SMOTE function to even the dependent variable (y variable).
